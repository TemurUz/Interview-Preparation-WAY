#  Java Concurrency in Practice :coffee: :arrows_counterclockwise:

This book covers a very deep and subtle topic in a very clear and concise way, making it the
perfect Java Concurrency reference manual. Each page is filled with the problems (and solutions!)
that programmers struggle with every day. Effectively exploiting concurrency is becoming more and more important
now that Moore's Law is delivering more cores but not faster cores, and this book will show you how to do it.
